# 0.1.2 #

V1
--------------------------------------------------
* Updated from 0.1.0 RC13 V3
* Added references to 0.1.0, 0.1.1, and 0.1.2 in <kbd>**Figura.version**</kbd> and *`avatar.schema.json`*.
* There are way too many changes here for me to list right now. Come back later.

V2
--------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a few deprecation descriptions.
  * `block_state` incorrectly called itself "block-state"
  * `ModelPart.getShader` was incorrectly listed as having no replacement
  * `Vector.asTable` had a "code replacemen" ðŸ’€
  * `WorldAPI.isLightning` wasn't actually marked as deprecated.
* Added vmerror tag to `parseJson` "on JSON parsing error"
